This is my solution in C to the Banker's Lab given in the Operating Systems class at NYU CAS Fall 2019. 
This rep offers the input files, the instructions of the lab and my solution code.
Score 97/100. 


To compile run the command: gcc -std=c99 banker_lab_3_-.c -lm
To test the inputs run the command ./a.out <input-file>
Replace <input-file> with the file you want to test e.g input-01, input-02, etc.
